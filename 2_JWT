JWT commonly knows as json web token . It is used for authentication , authorization and information exchange. It consist of three parts :- header , payload and signature. and it is stateless. since jwt contains all the ne
cessary information within itself , the server doesn't need to maintain session information.

so , how does jwt works ?
whenever clint tries to log in to the server to access some informatino and when the user is able to authenticate itself , the server generate a jwt token for the clien.
the client store it in local storage or cookie.for every subsequent request which need authentication , the client send the jwt in the request headers .the server validates the token by checking the signature and
decoding the payload.
