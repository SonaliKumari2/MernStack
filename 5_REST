The full form of REST is Representation State Transfer (API) Application Programming Interface . REST is a api which follow a set of rules to communicate with each other.
It is used for communicatino between two system , where it allows
client to request data to the server and server can sent the data to the client in a structured format.so , 
representation -> data is presented in the form of json.
state -> current condition / data of a resource.
transfer -> data is transferred between client and server.

Now , rest apis are stateless. they are stateless because the request sent from a client to a server will contain all the information that is required to understand
the requests to the server.

Methods of rest apis -> we do crud operations here . means we create a resource , read a resource , update a resource and delete a resource.

API -> Application Programming Interface . It is a bridge that allows two applications to talk to each other. so, basically , frontend makes a request ,
api processes the request , and backend sends the response. wihout rest apis , the response is sent in the form of html which is not appropriate.

Now , there is a slight difference between rest apis and restful apis . 
a rest api is a general term while the working of the restful apis is completely based on the rest principles.
